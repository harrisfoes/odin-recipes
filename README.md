# odin-recipes
This is the first project in the foundations course<br />
This project will demonstrate my knowledge in html and CSS<br />
I have worked on these technologies before, but using the command line 
and github would be new for me<br />
<br />

It's a website of recipes<br />
Knowing me, it will probably be silly
